    <h4>Can I use my own fonts?</h4>
    <p>Unfortunately, Superstring does not support to use custom fonts in your computer. However, we continue to add
        fonts to Superstring every update. We strive to diversify our selection to give our users as many choices as
        possible. If you have fonts you want us to add, simply <a href="/support/contact">contact</a> us and we will
        do
        our best to add it to Superstring.</p>

    <h4>Error: "The publisher of Superstring couldn't be verified."</h4>
    <p>While downloading Superstring, if you are getting an error "The publisher of Superstring couldn't be
        verified."
        or "The publisher of this program couldn't be verified", please try to download it again using a different

    <div class="anchor" id="what-happens-if-i-dont-renew-my-license"></div>
    <h4>What happens if I don't renew my license?</h4>
    <p>If you don't want to renew your license after it expires, you can continue to use the version of Superstring
        that
        you have, for as long as you want, but you won't be able to receive any further updates. If you decide you
        want
        to renew at a later date, you're welcome back at any time.</p>
    <div class="anchor" id="when-will-i-have-to-renew-my-license"></div>
    <h4>When will I have to renew my license?</h4>
    <p>Your license is valid for 1 year after the date of purchase so if you bought your license today {{site.time |
        date: "%b %-d, %Y"}}, you'll get all the regular updates that are released up to {{site.time | date: "%b
        %-d"}},
        {{site.time | date: "%Y" | plus:1}}. To receive updates after that date, you'll need to renew your
        license.</p>
    <div class="anchor" id="can-i-install-superstring-on-multiple-computers"></div>

    <h4>Superstring crashes when a lyric video is exporting</h4>
    <p>It might be memory or performance-related. Please try these suggestions. The most common causes for that problem can be solved with these few steps: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce the number of text styles. Working with many text styles use more system resources.</li>
      <li>Reduce the number of background images. Working with many background images use more system resources.</li>
      <li>Remove effects. Effects uses a lot of system resources.</li>
      <li>Export a lyric video in HD 720p. HD 720p is sufficient in most cases such as YouTube and Facebook.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the problem persists after you've tried these, please <a href="/support/contact?subject=Superstring crashes when a lyric video is exporting.">contact</a> us.</p>
    <div class="anchor" id="how-do-i-play-my-lyric-video"></div>
