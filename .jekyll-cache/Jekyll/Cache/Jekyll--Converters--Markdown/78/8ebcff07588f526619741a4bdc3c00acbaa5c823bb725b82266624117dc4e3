I"í<p>Weâ€™ve recently released Superstring 3 and Membrane 2.
So itâ€™s time to share what we think is a better idea regarding updates.</p>

<p>Until now, it has been our custom to release a major version of 1, 2 every couple of years as a paid upgrade, with minor updates(1.1, 1.2, etc) for free in between. While this is a very common model for apps, we donâ€™t think it is fair: customers who have purchased an app closer to the original release date get free updates for longer than someone who bought the same product halfway through its release cycle. We think a fairer approach is for everybody to get the same period of free updates, no matter when they purchased the app.</p>

<p>We would also prefer to ship big updates and improvements frequently, when theyâ€™re ready, rather than waiting for the next major version to come around in order to entice people to upgrade. As a consequence, we intend to remove the distinction between major and minor releases altogether.</p>

<h4 id="is-this-a-subscription">Is this a subscription?</h4>
<p>No. Once your license has expired, you can still use Superstring or Membrane for as long as you want. Weâ€™ll not force you to pay again to use it. You donâ€™t have to renew your license if you donâ€™t want to.</p>

<h4 id="when-will-i-have-to-renew-my-license">When will I have to renew my license?</h4>
<p>Youâ€™ll not have to renew if you donâ€™t want to. Your license is valid for 1 year after the date of purchase so if you bought your license today Jan 16, 2020, youâ€™ll get all the regular updates that are released up to Jan 16, 2021. To receive updates after that date, youâ€™ll need to renew your license.</p>

<h4 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-renew-my-license">What happens if I donâ€™t renew my license?</h4>
<p>If you donâ€™t want to renew your license after it expires, you can continue to use the version of Superstring or Membrane that you have, for as long as you want, but you wonâ€™t be able to receive any further updates. If you decide you want to renew at a later date, youâ€™re welcome back at any time.</p>

<h4 id="how-will-this-affect-my-license">How will this affect my license?</h4>
